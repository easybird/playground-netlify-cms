At 6h30 in the morning, after hours of contractions already at home, we arrived at the hospital. Betty had a hard time having contractions each 3 minutes or so. But we doubted as the contractions still didn't last long.. But luckily we gave the hospital a call..they told us to pass by for a checkup. We arrived and she already had 4 cm's! The next two hours labour took care of two more centimeters.. And then surprisingly, everything went very fast.. 1 hour later she already had 9 cm and was almost ready to push! At 12h48, Nina saw light for the first time. Fantastic but scary moment when they lay down that naked and slippery little baby on my breast for the first time!

By the way, mom did a GREAT job during labour! She managed to gave birth without any form of medication and gave birth in a bath tub, just as she wanted.. That great woman will be a wonderful mother!
